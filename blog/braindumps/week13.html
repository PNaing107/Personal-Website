            <h2 class="underline">Week 13: Working with Legacy Code & Green Software Development</h2>
                <p>
                    From Monday to Thursday, we continued with the Academy Portal Project which we started the previous Friday. 
                    In my opinion, this was by far the most valuable project to work on in terms of preparing yourself for the real world of software development. 
                    We managed to complete Story 1 - 3 and got close to completing Story 4; the functionality for the reporting feature was working but we didn’t 
                    have time to write suitable unit tests, which was a shame, but hopefully a future cohort can pick this up. 
                    Here are my main takeaways from working on this project:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Estimating how long it will take to complete a task is so hard when you are not familiar with the code base. 
                        As a team we massively underestimated Story 1 and 4 and we overestimated Story 2 & 3. 
                        (As a side note I learnt that there is an actual word for this: <em>Floccinaucinihilipilification</em> - it means the action of estimating something as worthless). 
                        We were lucky that our inaccurate estimates managed to counteract each other but it could have easily gone the other way. 
                        When working out in industry I will definitely follow the sales mantra of “underpromise and over deliver” and allocate more time for testing when working with legacy code.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Working with Legacy Code is hard.</strong> It takes time to understand the code that others have written and you have to hope that they have written appropriate unit tests. 
                        During the week our team saw a lot of inconsistencies in terms of coding style, naming variables and implementing coding best practices 
                        (like separation of concerns and keeping code DRY ) which means we have to make decisions about what standards we want to apply. And these decisions can be costly. 
                        For example, me and Owen, when working on Story 1, decided to rename a few variables to more semantic names. We ran the unit tests and they passed however when we did manual testing we found that we had broken the programme. 
                        It took us several hours and help from our trainer before we could track down the issue. When we realised how time consuming it would be to fix the issue we ultimately decided to revert back to the original names.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The last point made me realise how important it is to establish a standard / style guide at the beginning 
                        of a new project. It just makes the code easier to read which can actually save a lot of time and mental effort. 
                        It doesn’t have to be painful to adhere to these standards either as you can incorporate static code analysis tools 
                        into the CI pipeline to reject code that fails to meet the agreed standards.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Refactoring Code can be hard. Modern applications are continuously evolving and can consist of hundreds of files that 
                        depend on each other and it isn’t always obvious what those dependencies are. 
                        It is highly likely that you are going to encounter code that is suboptimal (it might have even been written by yourself in the past when you were less experienced). 
                        What do you do in this situation? On one hand you could ignore it and leave it for someone else to deal with in the future. After all, the application still works and 
                        delivering a working product to the customer is the most important thing right? But what if requirements change and your quick and dirty solution is no longer acceptable? 
                        It could be much more painful to refactor the code in the future. As a junior developer, I think the approach I will take is to consult with the Technical lead and follow their advice.

                    This week we also had 3 guest lectures. The first one was on Functional Programming within the context of Javascript. It expanded on some of the concepts we were taught in Week 6 
                    when learning about Javascript. The second was an Introduction to <a href="https://laravel.com/" target="_blank">Laravel</a>. This is a PHP framework for building complete web applications 
                    and it comes with a lot of features to make the development process easier. The final lecture was a really thought provoking one. It was about Green Software Development practices. 
                    Unsurprisingly the Internet, which accounts for roughly 10% of global electricity demand, is a major contributor of greenhouse gas emissions. However there is a lot that we can all do as both users 
                    and contributors of the Internet to reduce this footprint. Below are some links that were shared by the guest speaker and I certainly plan to read through this when I get some downtime after the Bootcamp.
