            <h2 class="underline">Week 1: HTML and CSS</h2>
            <p>
                The wait is finally over. I have returned to Bath, 7 years after I first came to the city as a fresh faced 18 year old and 2 years since I graduated from the University of Bath in the midst of the COVID 19 pandemic. It felt somewhat like déjà vu. 
                After all, I was returning as a student again, eager to develop new skills and to make new friends but also quite nervous about the 16 weeks I had ahead of me. That mild anxiety was quickly dispelled within the first hour of joining the iOAcademy. 
                I was greeted at the door by my trainer Neal, who shook my hand in a very jovial manner and took me to the classroom. The classrooms at the academy were all named after Marvel superheroes and ours was Iron Man. I did not make the connection at the 
                time but as I am writing this post a small part of me wonders if this is more than just a coincidence. (You can read my post about <a href="../bp1.html" target="_blank">Why I decided to Pursue Software Engineering</a>, to see the significance of this) 
                To break the ice Neal got us to pair up (as there were 8 trainees) and we had to answer some questions about ourselves which our pair would then share with the rest of the group. It was really interesting to learn about my fellow trainees. We all came 
                from different backgrounds and were at different points in our lives but we all had one thing in common - a genuine desire to learn web development. Immediately I had a feeling we would get along.
            </p>
            <p>
                After a quick tour of the building, we jumped straight into the theory. The starting point for most web developers is of course learning HTML and CSS and that is also where our bootcamp journey began. Down the rabbit hole I go……..

            <p>These videos from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Fireship" target="_blank">Fireship.io</a> do a really good job of explaining the two languages:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ok-plXXHlWw" target="_blank">HTML in 100s</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEV8gMkCHXQ" target="_blank">CSS in 100s</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Below are some takeaways from this week that aren't covered in the videos:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    On our course when building websites we will be taking a “mobile-first” approach. This means we will write our html and css so that the website looks good on a mobile phone and then adapt it to larger screens. 
                    This is because more than 50% of web traffic is coming through mobile devices
                </li>
                <li>
                    Accessibility -  this is a huge topic and was only briefly discussed this week. It is about making your website easy to use for people with disabilities who may have to use assistive technologies like screen readers
                </li>
                <li>
                    We will also be developing for the “Evergreen” Browsers (Google Chrome, Safari, Firefox and Microsoft Edge) as they are the most popular browsers and they regularly improve their software in the background
                </li>
                <li>
                    Inspector - This is a really useful tool provided by the Browsers that allow you to see the HTML and CSS that is being used on a website. Quite overwhelming for a beginner as it has a lot of functionality. 
                    For now I only use the Elements window to select HTML elements and see the CSS styles that are being applied to it and the Toggle device button to see how the website looks on different devices
                </li>
                <li>
                    Cross Browser Issues - Different Browsers have different default settings meaning that your websites will not look identical on each browser. It is common to use a CSS file to standardise the default settings in each browser. 
                    (Make sure you link this before linking to other stylesheets)
                </li>
                <li>
                    How to support older versions of browsers? 2 approaches: Graceful Degradation Vs Progressive enhancement <a href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/Graceful_degradation_versus_progressive_enhancement" target="_blank">(find out more)</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/what-is-a-wireframe-guide/" target="_blank">Wireframing</a> - Before jumping into HTML and CSS it will be much easier to build a website if you have a outline of how content will be laid out. This is done in early stages of the project life cycle usually by a UX/UI designer
                </li>
                <li>
                    Team work makes the dream work - pair programming and code reviews are really good habits to adopt when writing software
                </li>
                <li>
                    Rubber Ducking - a technique to help get unstuck on a coding problem. Explain your code /problem to a rubber duck. This forces your brain to approach the issue from a different perspective and may uncover the solution
                </li>
            </ul>
