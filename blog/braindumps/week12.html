            <h2 class="underline">Week 12: Career Advice, MVC & PHP Frameworks</h2>
            <p>
                This week started off with a Careers day. Mike, the lead trainer at iO Academy, 
                gave us advice on how to write a CV tailored towards developer roles, 
                apply for jobs and what to expect during the interview process. 
                Although I was in the extremely lucky position of having already secured a job upon completion of the bootcamp, 
                I found his advice very helpful. 
                Here are the main takeaways I got:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Keep the design of the CV consistent with your portfolio website
                </li>
                <li>
                    Get a separate email address and mobile number solely for work 
                    (unless you want to run the risk having your personal inbox bombarded with messages from recruiters)
                </li>
                <li>
                    The “About Me” section is key to making your CV stand out. Employers care about your interests, 
                    especially for entry level roles. They are looking for someone with a genuine passion for programming and proven ability to work effectively in a team so try to highlight these traits. 
                    Don’t overshare though as you want to give them the opportunity to ask follow up questions in the interview
                </li>
                <li>
                    Don’t give yourself a label like "Junior" or  "Senior" Developer as different companies have different 
                    requirements for what those labels are
                </li>
                <li>
                    Don’t rate your skills. What does a 7/10 in Javascript even mean?
                </li>
                <li>
                    Don’t open yourself up to discrimination. <strong>This is a big one.</strong>  Everyone can think in a way that involves unconscious bias at some point. 
                    Whilst it is almost impossible to eradicate, you can reduce your chances by excluding your date of birth, specific address of residence and a photo of yourself from the CV
                </li>
                <li>
                    When applying direct, always send a covering letter and make it specific to the company
                </li>
                <li>
                    Agencies vs Software as a Service (SaaS). These are the 2 main types of companies you will encounter as a developer. 
                    In general these are the main differences between the 2 types:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Agencies tend to have shorter project deadlines so the focus is on speed over quality
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            They might work with a range of clients which might increase the variety of work and allow you to work with “cutting edge” tech
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            SaaS companies tend to be more focused and have longer-term roadmaps
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            SaaS companies tend to prioritise code quality over speed
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Generally speaking, compensation will be better at a SaaS company
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    When searching for companies, think about which style of work suits you better. 
                    It can be difficult to switch from one to the other.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Every company has a different application process. The most common is a 3 stage process consisting of:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Initial interview - basic technical questions, usually with at least 1 developer
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Technical test
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Final interview - personality based, usually with Lead Developer/CTO/Director
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Preparation is the key to success for all 3 stages. For the interview you should have a 
                    basic understanding of what the company does and have questions about the role you are applying for. 
                    Be honest, if you don’t know the answer just say so. Instead you could also talk about how you would 
                    find the answer / what you do know related to the question instead
                </li>
                <li>
                    Ask for feedback after the interview - it's a learning experience!
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday were standard theory days. We covered the Model View Controller (MVC) architecture. 
                This is a widely adopted approach when building a Web App and involves separating the application into 3 distinct parts. 
                The Model is the layer that interacts with data storage (typically a database). The view is the output (i.e. what the end user will see) which is typically in 
                HTML, XML or JSON format. The Controller is the “glue” that connects the model and the view and is where the business logic is applied. 
                To build an MVC application from scratch is hard which is why most developers use a framework (checkout my <a href="./week8.html">Week 8 Brain Dump</a> for more info on frameworks). 
                We were taught the Slim Framework for PHP. It is a lightweight un-opinionated framework and the main benefit it provided was routing; a way to map a URL to a particular piece of code. 
                I managed to create a simple <em>To Do List App</em> with it which allowed you to add, edit and delete tasks.
            </p>
            <p>
                We also covered REST, a design principle for developing APIs. I think <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-MTSQjw5DrM">this video</a> explains it nicely.
            </p>
            <p>
                The last bit of theory we covered was Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD). 
                This comes under the topic of DevOps and is about committing new code to production in small regular intervals and automating the processes along the way. 
                It reduces the chances of “bad” code being pushed into production and reduces the amount of things code reviewers have to check. 
            </p>
            <p>
                On Friday we started our 6th project. This was earlier than usual as we managed to cover all the theory and exercises by Thursday. 
                The project was different from the previous ones we had undertaken as we would be working on an existing codebase - the iO Acadamy portal. 
                Also I decided to volunteer to be Scrum Master. (For more details about what that entails you can check out my Week 4 Brain Dump). After our story estimation and planning sessions we decided to accept 4 stories. 
                Story 1 was a bug about inconsistent error messages and inability to dismiss the success messages. Someone previously decided that papyrus was a suitable font but they did not apply this to every error message.
                We decided to apply the default bootstrap styling to all error messages instead. Story 2 was another bug. When you deleted a trainer from the portal they still showed up as a check box option when you try to complete the Add Courses form.
                Story 3 was technical debt. It would require us to reformat all date input fields in this structure: dd/mm/yyyy
                Finally Story 4 was a new feature request. The Academy Admins wanted to have the ability to run some reporting on the applicant data.
                We made a start on the first 2 stories in the afternoon and managed to complete 11 out of the 91 task points we had estimated.
