            <p>
                This week was our first project week. It was time to put the theory we learnt last week about HTML and CSS into practice by building our own portfolio website. 
                The brief was pretty straightforward. We had to design and build a responsive website with at least 3 sections: an About Me, Portfolio and Contact section. 
                We were also asked to build this on <a href="https://replit.com/" target="_blank">Replit</a> which is a browser based IDE (Integrated Development Environment). 
            </p>
            <p>
                Because this would be our personal website I felt great pressure to make the website look as impressive as I could and spent far too long looking online at other peopleâ€™s work for inspiration. 
                This can be quite dangerous in my opinion. The examples that come up on top of the Google searches are usually ones made by seasoned pros who are using far more advanced languages than just HTML and plain CSS. 
                This can feel demoralising for us mere mortals so I had to remind myself to stop procrastinating as this portfolio can always be updated in the future. With that in my mind I quickly came up with some simple mobile 
                and desktop wireframes for my website. I decided to go with a fixed header and footer as my website didnâ€™t need a navigation bar and I wanted to give it a native app feeling on mobile devices. This was approved by 
                my trainer Neal so then I started writing out the HTML and then styling it with CSS. Having a wireframe, essentially a blueprint for my website, is so important as it made writing the HTML and CSS a breeze. Despite that 
                I still managed to not follow my own design. ðŸ¤¦ At the end of the week (and at the end of every project week for that matter) we have something called a Sprint Review (I will go into this in more detail in a future post). 
                This is where the development team gets to showcase what they managed to achieve during the Sprint to the end customer (A sprint is a short, time-boxed period when a scrum team works to complete a set amount of work). After 
                I presented my website Neal noticed that I had my buttons on my project portfolio cards the wrong way round. In this scenario the order of the buttons is quite arbitrary but it was still embarrassing as I had no good reason 
                for doing it. I simply forgot to refer back to my wireframe. It was a good mistake for me to make though as I will be more attentive when I have to follow a given design in the future.
